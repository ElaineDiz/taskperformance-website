                Regulation is the most prominent financial risk associated with the treatment of animals on factory farms. And in the United States and elsewhere, the industry is already grappling with it. Increasing consumer awareness and concern regarding standard factory-farming practices such as extreme confinement and routine mutilations without anesthetic among other common procedures are driving bans on such practices. As the nonprofit ratings agency Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), has put it, “There is increasing public and regulatory scrutiny of meat, poultry, and dairy companies and their suppliers' treatment of animals…[a] Consumer demand has driven shifts in industry practices such as eliminating the use of gestation crates in hog production and eliminating caged enclosures for poultry.”[1] Since the late 1990s, the EU has enacted bans on various factory farming confinement systems, including veal crates, gestation crates, and battery cages. In the U.S., twelve states have banned the use of intensive confinement systems and the in-state sale of animals kept in such systems in other states. To date, the factory farming industry's efforts to overturn U.S. laws based on claims they violate the Constitution's Commerce and Due Process clause have been unsuccessful, including in early 2019, when the Supreme Court declined to hear challenges to animal welfare laws passed by ballot in California and Massachusetts.[3] The industry's efforts to overturn the laws are likely to continue, however, given that these significantly burden factory farming operations by requiring they make costly adjustments to their operations or cease selling products across certain state lines.
